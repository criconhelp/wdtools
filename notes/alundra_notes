      - chunk 0 = ?
        - palettes
        - warps
        - can copy over from one map to another and break only those things?
        - structure:
          - first 4b? are map number?
          - followed by palette (3b RGB??)
          - other stuff starts at 0x42A?
            - warp data?
            - 0x24 bytes each?
